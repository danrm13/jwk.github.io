  <h1>Who I am</h1>
  <p>Hey! I’m Kaylin! I am a novice adventurer who is learning to rock climb and dabble in low-key mountaineering who also 
    enjoys granny-level hobbies like knitting and tending to my roses. I love being out in nature and exploring God’s beautiful 
    creation.
    <br><br>
    I’m a boy mama, wife, and RN who left her soul-sucking career as a bedside nurse to live a more aligned and purpose-driven 
    life.
    <br><br>
    I am a recovering perfectionist who used to place her worth in her “accomplishments” and “successes” until I realized that 
    was causing so much anxiety and was kind of a BS way to live my life. I now know that my worth doesn’t come from what I can 
    do, it comes from who I am! So I am out here striving to be my very BEST!
    <br><br>
    I used to be so afraid of failure and others’ opinions of me that I wouldn’t try something unless I knew I could be 
    successful. But gone is that mentality! I am striving to live a life free of self-limiting fears and doubts so I can go after 
    big scary dreams and do challenging things!
    <br><br>
    And THAT is what I want for you friend! I want you to conquer your own self-limiting fears and doubts and step into the 
    badass person you are meant to be! I want you to not fear failure or looking the fool because you have and unshakable 
    confidence and love for yourself! I want you to be unapologetically YOU and to chase after the things that set your soul 
    on FIRE!
    <br><br>
    If there is one thing I have learned through the pandemic, it is that life is too short and too precious to be lived quietly.

  <h2>My Story</h2>
  <p>After my son, Isaiah, was born, I took some time off to be with him, but eventually went back to work as an ICU RN. 
    Eventually, the long nights away from him and breaking my body for a profession I lost my passion for led me to consider 
    being a coach.
    <br><br>
    As a critical care nurse, I saw SO much unnecessary suffering. People whose lifestyles were literally killing them but 
    the only help they got was some pills and a quick little “you gotta change your habits” lecture from a too busy, burnt out 
    doctor who didn’t really give a crap. I wanted so much more for my patients. I wanted to get to the root cause of why they 
    lived the way they did and why they got stuck in such unhealthy patterns, but there just wasn’t time for that. So much of 
    “health”care is really just “sick”care, get people well enough that they don’t die, throw some pills at a problem and then 
    repeat the same process over and over again until eventually it does catch up with them and they do die. It was all bandaid 
    solutions for a much deeper problem.
    <br><br>
    I was already dissatisfied in my career and felt like I couldn’t really help my patients like I wanted to and it was slowly 
    breaking me.
    <br><br>
    Then…. COVID hit.
    <br><br>
    An already broken healthcare system was brought to its knees and it crumbled to dust under the weight of the pandemic. What 
    little faith I had left in healthcare in the US was obliterated.
    <br><br>
    I have some serious soul wounds and moral injury from this time in my career that will take a long, LONG time to heal.
    <br><br>
    I was forced to keep people from seeing their loved ones. I held a crying woman with terminal illness as she sobbed about 
    her son not being able to visit her, and it broke me. I had to tell a man that he couldn’t stay by his wife’s side (to whom 
    he had been married for 20+ years) and he had to leave the hospital not knowing if she would make it through the night. It 
    was complete bullshit and, worse, completely out of my control.
    <br><br>
    I watched as cardiologists “deferred” their expert assessments and instead wanted to give me a quick report of what I 
    assessed because they didn’t want to risk going into the room of someone who “might” have COVID. I saw patients not get 
    potentially life-saving testing done because the radiology department couldn’t “risk exposure.” I saw subpar care, strained 
    staff, moral injury, and distressed patients everywhere I looked.
    <br><br>
    I was already about to the end of my rope. And then my sweet son was born. The thought of leaving him for any period of time 
    was breaking my heart! But the thought of leaving him to go work at a place I hate where I had to do work that was breaking 
    my soul was UNBEARABLE. I made it a couple months back in the critical care unit after my son was born but I didn’t last 
    long. I had debilitating anxiety attacks leading up to each shift and I couldn’t bear to see the injustices happening in the
    hospital.
    <br><br>
    The career I had wanted since I was a young child had BROKEN my SOUL and I was done!
    <br><br>
    Something had to change! I put in my notice and never looked back!
    <br><br>
    Then I found coaching…
